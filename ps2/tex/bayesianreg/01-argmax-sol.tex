\begin{answer}

\text{posterior distribution $\phi(\theta\mid x,y)$}
\begin {equation}
\begin {split}
\phi_{MAP} & = argmax p(\theta\mid x, y)   \label{this}\\     
& = argmax \frac{p(y\mid x, \theta) p(\theta\mid x)}{p(y\mid x)} \\
& = argmax  p(y\mid x, \theta) p(\theta) 
\end {split}
\end {equation}
We first use the Bayes rule to arrange $p(\theta \mid x, y)$

We don't take into account the denominator $p(y\mid x)$, as it is a positive constant. To get the posterior probability, we can ignore the denominator, as p(y) has no $\theta$ determinant.

Since we assume that x and $\theta$ are marginally independent; $p(\theta) = p(\theta\mid x)$
\[ \phi_{MAP} & = argmax p(\theta\mid x, y) & = argmax  p(y\mid x, \theta) p(\theta)  \]
