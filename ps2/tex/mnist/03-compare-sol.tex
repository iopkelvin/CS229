\begin{answer}
The baseline model obtained an accuracy of 92.8 percent

The regularization term lambda increased the accuracy significantly even though the regularization was only 0.0001

The accuracy obtained on the regularized model with lambda 0.0001 was 96.76 percent.

The regularization term has penalized the parameters that caused the model trained on the training set to be overfit. The regularization has caused the test set to increase accuracy, by having a better approximation to the parameters.
