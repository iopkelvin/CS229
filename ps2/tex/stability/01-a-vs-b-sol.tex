\begin{answer}

When running the logistic regression model on both datasets A and B, we notice that dataset A converges quickly after a few iterations. Dataset B goes through an infinite amount of iterations before converging. It does not get to achieve convergence because logistic regression cannot find a local optima when classes have a linear separation.
